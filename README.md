# Zoo Bazaar

This is a collaborative project for which we were given a situation of a zoo that faces multiple management difficulties and has an improper and outdated administrative system. We had to define the problems and build an IT solution that would improve the current situation of zoo (see more details in Documentation/Project Plan). Our solution consists of a desktop application that supports multiple account types and handle animal and employee data, provide both automized and manual scheduling, support animal transfers and zoo collaboations. We also created a web application designed for the general public with the purpose of promoting the zoo and encouraging people to buy tickets. The website also supports schedule overview for caretakers (one type of employee)
